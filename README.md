### Before we star
Welcome to the Formik tutorial. This will teach you everything you need to know to build simple and complex forms in React.

###  Overview: What is Formik?

# Screen Shots
    Formik is a small group of React components and hooks for building forms in React and React Native. It helps with the three most annoying parts:

    Getting values in and out of form state
    Validation and error messages
    Handling form submission
    By colocating all of the above in one place, Formik keeps things organized--making testing, refactoring, and reasoning about your forms a breeze.
